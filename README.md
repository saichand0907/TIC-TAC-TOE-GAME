 Tic Tac Toe - Two Player Mode
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game written in Python that allows two players to play against each other in the terminal.

🧠 Game Rules
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

Two players take turns to mark the spaces with X and O.

The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
